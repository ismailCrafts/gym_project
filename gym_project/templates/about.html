        {# ------------------ Our Story ------------------ #}
        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          Iron Temple was founded on a belief that fitness is more than lifting weights—it’s a way of life. 
          Our journey began with a small group of passionate fitness enthusiasts who wanted to create a space 
          where people of all levels could come together, push their boundaries, and discover the true potential 
          of both body and mind. Over time, this vision grew into a thriving fitness community that has become 
          a second home for hundreds of members.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the very beginning, our goal has been simple: to provide the best environment, the best equipment, 
          and the best guidance possible, so every individual who walks through our doors can achieve meaningful results. 
          Whether you’re stepping into the gym for the very first time or you’ve been training for years, Iron Temple is built 
          to support your journey.
        </p>

        {# ------------------ Our Philosophy ------------------ #}
        <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          At Iron Temple, we don’t just train muscles—we train discipline, confidence, and resilience. 
          We see fitness as a lifestyle, not a short-term goal. That’s why our philosophy is centered on balance: 
          balancing strength with endurance, discipline with motivation, and physical health with mental well-being. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To us, the gym is more than a collection of machines. It’s a sacred space where people challenge their limits, 
          break past barriers, and transform into stronger versions of themselves. Every rep, every drop of sweat, 
          and every milestone achieved is a testament to hard work, patience, and consistency. 
          That’s why we call it the <strong>Iron Temple</strong>—a temple where strength, growth, and dedication are celebrated.
        </p>
